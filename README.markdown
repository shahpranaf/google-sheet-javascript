Google-Spreadsheet-Javascript
=============================

This is a simple jQuery plugin sort of thingy that allows JavaScript applications to pull data from Google spreadsheets.


See [sample.html](https://github.com/mikeymckay/google-spreadsheet-javascript/blob/master/sample.html) for the most basic usage ([See it in action here](http://mikeymckay.github.com/google-spreadsheet-javascript/sample.html)).
Look at the [QUnit tests](https://github.com/mikeymckay/google-spreadsheet-javascript/blob/master/tests) to see all of the things that the library can do.


TODO:

* Use Google Forms for saving data
* Improve conventions for setting/getting properties

NOTES:

I wrote this in coffeescript, so I have included the original coffee source files, but you only need the JavaScript files to use it.
